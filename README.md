The aim of this project was to create a replica of the Google Homepage. The
HTML was very simple so I regard this as an exercise in styling, though if I'm
honest, I'm sure my HTMl is rather primitive currently. I largely used flexbox
to style the content of the page, while using only a few specific rules for 
smaller elements. I clearly need more work with creating efficient divs and
using that to make styling more efficient. 

Through this project I have demonstrated an understanding in:
-Flexbox
-using margins and padding
-interactables like buttons, inputs, and <a>links.
-becoming frustrated by simple projects because I overthought my solution.
